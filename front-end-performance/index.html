<section>
  <h1>Front-end performance</h1>
  <aside class="notes">The reason we are calling this session "front-end performance" instead of "CSS performance" is that we are going to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.</aside>

    <h2>How does the browser display pages?</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="fragment">Layout</span>
      <span class="fragment">→ Paint</span>
      <span class="fragment">→ Composite</span>
    </p>
    <aside class="notes">This is the simplified, generalized version, of course.</aside>

  <section>
    <p>What types of things trigger a layout change (reflow)?</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">Adding, removing, updating DOM nodes</li>
      <li class="fragment">Hiding a DOM node with <code>display: none;</code></li>
      <li class="fragment">Resizing the window, changing font-size, scrolling</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">Though "display: none;" causes a reflow, "visibility: hidden;" does not.</aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If you are going to change elements' styles, try to do it in batch to minimize the number of reflows.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> <code>cloneNode()</code> an element, make changes to the copy, and swap it for the original.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If you have to make lots of changes, hide the element via <code>display: none;</code>, make your changes, and then unhide it (triggering only two reflows).</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Paint, composite</h2>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Performing a re-paint and a re-composite only is faster than re-doing all three steps.</p>
    <aside class="notes">That's why we focus so much on avoiding reflows where possible.</aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Ideally, we can skip re-painting as well, and re-composite only. This is typically quite fast.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>3D transforms get elements on their own compositing layers and don't require a reflow or a repaint.</p>
    <p class="fragment">Sometimes the GPU can help out with these, too.</p>
    <aside class="notes">This can come with a startup cost, however.</aside>

    <aside class="notes">The bottom line: certain properties are more expensive to animate than others.</aside>

TODO:

* CSS usually outperforms jQuery. Show transit plugin. Include Ben's caveat.
* Show examples of:
  * The timeline view (Chrome) and chrome://tracing
  * Dropped framerate due to reflows
* Add sources links at end of slides:
