<section>
  <h1>Front-end performance</h1>
  <aside class="notes">The reason we are calling this session "front-end performance" instead of "CSS performance" is that we are going to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.</aside>

    <h2>How does the browser display pages?</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="fragment">Layout</span>
      <span class="fragment">→ Paint</span>
      <span class="fragment">→ Composite</span>
    </p>
    <aside class="notes">This is the simplified, generalized version, of course.</aside>

  </section>
  <section>
    <p>What types of things trigger a layout change (reflow)?</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">Adding, removing, updating DOM nodes</li>
      <li class="fragment">Hiding a DOM node with <code>display: none;</code></li>
      <li class="fragment">Resizing the window, changing font-size, scrolling</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">Though "display: none;" causes a reflow, "visibility: hidden;" does not.</aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If you are going to change elements' styles, try to do it in batch to minimize the number of reflows.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> <code>cloneNode()</code> an element, make changes to the copy, and swap it for the original.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If you have to make lots of changes, hide the element via <code>display: none;</code>, make your changes, and then unhide it (triggering only two reflows).</p>
  </section>
</section>

<section>
  <section>
    <h2>Paint, composite</h2>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Performing a re-paint and a re-composite only is faster than re-doing all three steps.</p>
    <aside class="notes">That's why we focus so much on avoiding reflows where possible.</aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Ideally, we can skip re-painting as well, and re-composite only. This is typically quite fast.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>3D transforms get elements on their own compositing layers and don't require a reflow or a repaint.</p>
    <p class="fragment">Sometimes the GPU can help out with these, too.</p>
    <aside class="notes">This can come with a startup cost, however.</aside>

    <p>An awesome resource: <a href="http://csstriggers.com/">CSS Triggers</a> by <a href="http://aerotwist.com/">Paul Lewis</a>.</p>
    <aside class="notes">The bottom line: certain properties are more expensive to animate than others.</aside>

    <h2>Other performance considerations</h2>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Selector performance is probably not a bottleneck anymore.</p>
    <aside class="notes">
      Write good, meaningful selectors. Browsers have been optimizing the rendering engine to handle complex selectors. There is lower-hanging fruit elsewhere.
    </aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>CSS animations usually outperform jQuery animations.</p>
    <aside class="notes">Ben Dilts, our CTO and founder, has found a few cases where using JS and requestAnimationFrame() is more performant than the CSS animation equivalent. Weird. Also, if you don't want to move away from jQuery animations, there are plugins like jquery.transit that may help.</aside>

    <h2>Debugging performance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Chrome DevTools: timeline view</li>
      <li>chrome://tracing (A.K.A. about:tracing)</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">Let's take a look at these tools.</aside>
